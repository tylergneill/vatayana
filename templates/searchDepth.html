           <h1>Search Depth</h1>

           </br>

			<p>
				Here you can modify the depth of the document similarity search.
				There are two depth levels for you to configure and switch between as you find useful
				("shallow" and "deep").

			<h2>More info</h2>

		   <p>
			   The idea here is that TF-IDF and Smith-Waterman comparisons are relatively slow,
			   and doing more and more of either gets diminishing returns.

			   Therefore, we set a limit on how many topic candidates are compared with TF-IDF,
			   as well as how many TF-IDF candidates are compared with Smith-Waterman.

			   Due to their different natures and what they compare,
			   this strategy works to keep computation time relatively low
			   but still get good results.
		   </p>
		   <p>
			   Top TF-IDF and Smith-Waterman similarity scores are stored in a database,
			   which allows for much faster loading.

			   Currently, the 500 best TF-IDF scores and the 25 best Smith-Waterman results are stored.

			   As users continue using the system, more results are stored, up to limits of 4000 and 200, respectively.

			   So if you chose numbers up to 4000 and 200, your results will be saved for later,
			   and you'll wait less time the next time. But if you chose above those limits,
			   you'll receive your correct results back after waiting the necessary time,
			   but nothing over those limits will be saved.

			   Note that these limits apply <i>before</i> filtering for one's chosen priority texts.
           </p>
			<p>
				Total max loading time is estimated here for a docExplore query.
				For docCompare, which involves two docExplore queries, multiply the estimate by 2.
				At the moment, these estimates are not very accurate;
				per-comparison time estimates are too low,
				and on the other hand, the database has reduced overhead significantly.
				Nevertheless, it gives a rough idea of computational cost.
